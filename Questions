What are the main tasks that need to be performed?
- Testing & Reseraching different meathods to approach the recharegable electrical Air purifyer
- Set Delegations & responsibilities
- Planning circuitry 
- Sketch Design
- Designing modules on CAD programs
- Discuss main design issues (Get feedback)
- Test the design 
- Finalize designs of the project

What is the sequence of tasks?
- Squence can be seen in question 1

Identify how tasks can be broken into subtasks.
- The tasks can be broken down into different versions
  - Initial versions to understand the goal
  - Each Block as a subtask
  - Testing each block alone then within the bigger design

What are some required skiils for each tasks and subtask?
- Testing & Researching ==> Basic research skills 
- Planning circuitry  ==> Electric circuits knowlege (ENG17 and/or EEC100)
- Sketch Design ==> CAD/ Sketch software
- Designing modules on CAD programs
- Test the design ==> Debugging

How many people should be assigned to each task? Subtask?
- 2-3 people should be assigned to each subtask 
- 6-8 people should be on the same task
